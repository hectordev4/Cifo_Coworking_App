# Product Owner Justification

### Who will be?

   I would propose for this role, Andrés Guizzo. He's an Informatic Degree Student with only the last project to deliver to achieve his diplomature.

### Why?

Under my experience and sight from life, I think Andrés would be a nice **Product Owner** because he has many experience doing **backlogs**, has a nice organization and he has a nice view of what the **product** should and shouldn't have. Also his objective view and his experience traversing serious team projects is very valuable.

### Why not?

I think he has some integration issues as an individual. Lacks of a firm voice and often doubts a bit about what to say to the team.
