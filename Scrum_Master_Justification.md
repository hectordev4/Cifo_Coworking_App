# Scrum Master Justification

### Who will be?

   It would be me, Hector Valverde. I am a sound engineer with vision for programming, no previous studies about this last.

### Why?

I value a lot from myself my objectiveness in a group and the cool to say things that may not be taking with good taste. Also my experience in life helps me to identify how are the persons around me and detect any issues in them. My experience taking parts in previous band projects help me to identify all of the mentioned above, but maybe I lacked some methodology on it and the people around me weren't right for my kind of vision, as it is very close to Agile/Scrum and not everybody suits for that. I identify myself as a leader, so I want to approach my thinking process and vision to that.

### Why not?

Sometimes I'm moved by emotions, so they can influence a bit in my decisions but not that often. I need time to dig more into Scrum as I didn't do any previous work around that. Besides that I have some dark gray days which aren't suitable to do this task and I'm a bit a head in the clouds always thinking how to(s).
